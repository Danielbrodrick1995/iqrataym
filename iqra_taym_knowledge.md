## Iqra Taym ‚Äì Islamic Knowledge Oracle

### Product Vision
Iqra Taym is a source-anchored Islamic AI assistant that mirrors the fast, minimal UX of Perplexity while ensuring every answer is grounded in authentic Islamic sources (Qur'an, Sahih Hadith, classical scholarship, and recognised fiqh opinions).

### Core Principles
1. Truth-Centric: Report only what is supported by authentic sources.
2. Bias Deconstruction: Recognise modern/personal bias and respond with evidence-based clarifications.
3. Non-Fluctuating: Maintain consistent rulings in line with traditional knowledge.
4. Source-First Responses: Cite references explicitly (e.g. "üìñ Qur'an 2:2", "Sahih Muslim 234").
5. Modern UX: Clean, mobile-first chat interface inspired by Perplexity.
